# Readings - Week 03 - CSE 20289 - Systems Programming

In our third week, we are going to dive more deeply into automation.  We will wrap up the unfinished content on processes at the start of the week, begin with regular expressions and continue with regex's throughout the week, and then explore various interesting file types / formats including CSVs, JSONs, YAML, as well as Word documents and PDFs.
