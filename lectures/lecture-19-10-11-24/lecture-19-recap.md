# Recap - Lecture 19 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, did a bit of exploration on networking, rapidly covering TCP / IP and the basics as related to how networking settings / configurations can be accessed through the shell.  We then continued and started on shell scripting, looking at an example populating a file via re-direction and then running the script via the `she-bang`.  We wrapped up briefly looking at variables within a shell script as well as environmental variables.

## Key Points

Note that the key points will vary from the motivations that are mentioned in the slides.

* What are the key layers from the OSI 7 layer model?
* What is a router? What is a gateway?
* What is the dominant protocol that underpins web transfers?
* How do you fetch a web page from the shell?
* How do you get the IP address for a machine as well as various network settings for a host?
* What is `localhost`?
* What is DNS?
* Examine example with `cat` from the slides.  Why did it behave the way that it did with respect to the various standard UNIX files (stdin, stdout)?
* What is an environmental variable? How do you access it? Set it?
* What is the `she-bang`?


## Looking Ahead

Next week, we will be diving deeply into scripting and starting to write scripts with not only variables but also conditionals and control flow. Keep reading in the class textbook for the weekly readings.  Homework 6 will also be assigned that will involve both shell scripting as well as Python unit tests.
