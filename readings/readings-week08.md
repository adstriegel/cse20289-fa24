# Readings - Week 08 - CSE 20289 - Systems Programming

We now are well into the exploration of shell scripting.  Try to pay special attention to the slide decks and the shell scripts as well as the example shell scripts in the book.  Remember, the goal is to become extremely literate at parsing and understanding shell scripts as part of the course.  

## Readings

From [The Linux Command Line](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) - Scripting:

* Chapter 24 - Writing Your First Script
* Chapter 25 - Starting A Project
* Chapter 26 - Top-Down Design
* Chapter 27 - Flow Control: Branching With If
* Chapter 29 - Flow Control: Loopning With While and Until
* Chapter 30 - Troubleshooting
* Chapter 31 - Flow Control: Branching With Case
* Chapter 32 - Positional Parameters
* Chapter 33 - Flow Control: Looping With For

For a shorter version of the scripting chapters, you can read [Writing Shell Scripts](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_writing_shell_scripts.php) instead. However, the chapters above are listed to serve as a reference should you need them (they do a more thorough job of explaining the material).
