# Readings - Week 04 - CSE 20289 - Systems Programming

Our third week was a bit truncated with Father Dowd's inauguration and not having class on Friday.  We will continue on with regular expressions giving you a chance to evaluate various regular expressions on the quiz for the next week.  We will carry on in class on Monday with looking at processing various file formats and then transition into functional programming, looking at how we can simplify and lay the foundation for parallelization of our code.
