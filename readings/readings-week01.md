# Readings - Week 01 - CSE 20289 - Systems Programming

For the first week, we will be focusing on learning about [Git](https://git-scm.com/about) as well as doing a brief refresher on [Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/).  

## Reading - Python

If you are feeling reasonably comfortable with Python, you are welcome to just briefly skip the readings on Installation / First Steps and skim the Basics. The expectation is that you have had some Python via Intro to Engineering though you are not expected to be proficient yet in Python.  

* A Byte of Python
   * [Installation](https://python.swaroopch.com/installation.html)
   * [First Steps](https://python.swaroopch.com/first_steps.html)
   * [Basics](https://python.swaroopch.com/basics.html) 

While [Homework 0](../hw/hw00/README.md) does not have you explicitly run all that much Python code, you should make sure that you can run code on the CSE student machines.  Optionally, it would be a good idea to be able to run code locally on your own machine as well.

While you can use resources such as Google Co-Lab, keep in mind that final testing is best done on the CSE student machines.

## Reading - Git

We will doing plenty of work with Git. Before Friday's lecture, try to briefly skim the About Git page.  We will start originally just working on the repository without branching but will eventually explore branching and other advanced concepts in later homework assignments.

It is essential that for the first homework (Homework 0) that you learn how to use Git from the command line (shell).  Later on, we will relax things to let you do more via Visual Studio Code or other GUI tools but for now, you should definitely focus on doing things on the CSE student machines.

* Git Documentation
   * [About Git](https://git-scm.com/about)

## Looking Ahead

In [next week's reading](readings-week02.md) (posted on Friday), we will cover Python for the purposes of automation and simplifying our general programming tasks.  Remember that it is not necessary to read every single bit of text for the class but rather, it is OK to skim.  

We will also start with our weekly quizzes on Monday with the quizzes available on Sunday at noon.  The quizzes are meant to test how well you understood the readings (think big picture - less minutia).  You are more than welcome to take as much time as you need on the quizzes.
