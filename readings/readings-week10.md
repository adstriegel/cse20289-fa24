# Readings - Week 10 - CSE 20289 - Systems Programming

We will now be shifting gears from shell scripting into systems-oriented C programming. Our lecture on Monday will continue with practicing shell scripting and then shifting into system-oriented C programming, shoring up various underlying mechanics of C as well as how C interacts via systems calls with the operating system.

## Key Points

As you flip through the various readings, thing about the following questions.

   * What is a Makefile?
   * What are the basic C types and their sizes?  
   * What is the difference between a pointer and a string?
   * What is the difference between a pointer and an array?
   * What is typecasting?
   * What is gdb? What is valgrind?
   * How does malloc work?

## Readings

The readings for this week are:

[Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/index-wide.html)

   * While this is a review from Fundamentals of Computing, so skim through Chapter 1 through Chapter 7. In particular, focus on Chapter 5. Pointers, Chapter 6. Arrays, and Chapter 7. Strings.

[Notes for new Make users](http://gromnitsky.users.sourceforge.net/articles/notes-for-new-make-users/)

   * Again, most of this should be review from Fundamentals of Computing and Data Structures, so skim this document and make sure you understand how to write and use a Makefile.
