## Looking Ahead

Quizzes have resumed this week and Homework 5 is up / posted. Remember that homework is now back to individual homework.

In the next lecture, we will start to focus on redirection, specifically looking at how stdout, stdin, and stderr are related to fundamental files for a process and how we can harness / direct those standardized files / streams appropriately.
