# Recap - Lecture 11 - Topics Covered

In this lecture, we continued on a bit with iterators and generators, looking at generator example functions and generator expressions.  We then continued taking a look at the various types of parallelisms and how those might impact our ability to scale with our code.  We also discussed the futures package in Python.

## Key Points

* What is an iterator? What is a generator? 
* What is concurrency? What is parallelism?
* How is functional programming related to map and parallelism?
* What is task parallelism? What is data parallelism?
* What is embarrassingly parallel?
* What is a thread? How does it differ from a process? What is the executor pool?
* What is the Python GIL?

## Looking Ahead

In the next lecture, we will dive a bit into the weirdness on the question of generators and lazy evaluation.  We will wrap up parallelism and start to prepare for the first exam.
