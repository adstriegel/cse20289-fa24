# Readings - Week 02 - CSE 20289 - Systems Programming

In our second week, we will be diving into Python.  If your Python is relatively robust, you can largely skim / skip the Python readings.  If your Python is perhaps a bit less robust, you may want to do a deeper dive.  We will get into the Automate the Boring book starting in Week 3.
