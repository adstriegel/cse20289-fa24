# Recap - Lecture 12 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we started our practice for the first exam next week.  We wrapped up a few odds and ends on parallelism and then did a deep dive into the weirdness on generators and lazy evaluation.  We looked at using lambdas and filters on functions with multiple parameters (super useful for HW 3).

## Key Points

* What are the two concurrency pitfalls?
* What is the Python GIL? How does that impact our choice to parallelize?
* What is Amdahlâ€™s law?
* What is the producer / consumer model?

## Looking Ahead

On Friday, we will go through the two examples that were not covered in class as practice materials from last year.  We will also look at servers and a few text friendly protocols (ZMQ, MQTT) and if we have a chance, briefly discuss serverless computing.
