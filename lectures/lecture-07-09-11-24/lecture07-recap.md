# Recap - Lecture 7 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we discussed Homework 2, finished up Monday's lecture content on regular expressions (phone number regex), and discussed CSVs. 

In lieu of there not being class on Friday for Father Dowd's inauguration, Homework 2 has been shifted to be due one week later. The group information assignment will still be due Friday / Monday.
