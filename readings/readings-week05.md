# Readings - Week 05 - CSE 20289 - Systems Programming

Second verse, same focus but now thinking to working on big data.  For Week 5, we will be taking our knowledge of functional programming, specifically thinking about lambdas, map, reduce, and then will be expanding that to focus on parallel programming.
