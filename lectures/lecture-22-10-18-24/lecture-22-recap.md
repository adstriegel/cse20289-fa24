# Recap - Lecture 22 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we looked at shell scripting functionality, starting first with the findBig example from last lecture and then getting into functions, artithmetic, scoping, and signals.

* Understand the limitations of shell script arithmetic
* Understand scope in shell scripts
* Understand siganls and what the `trap` command does within a script
* What is a sub-shell?
* What is a bracket expansion?

## Looking Ahead

We are now on fall break.  Homework 6 wraps around break and focuses on unit tests for Python and a wrapper shell script to invoke the unit tests as well as check on the result of the unit tests.  When we get back, we will continue on with pipelining and filtering looking at how we combine various commands together in terms of their output into a different command input.  The next homework will also look at taking advantage of that pipeline in a rough approximation of a gateway-based virus scanner.
