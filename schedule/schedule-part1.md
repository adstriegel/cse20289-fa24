# CSE 20289 - Schedule - First Module

During the first part of the course, we will focus on conducting a refresher on [Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction) as well as diving deeper into several of the advanced aspects of Python including functional programming, iterators, and parallelization.  We will also cover [regular expressions](https://coderpad.io/blog/development/the-complete-guide-to-regular-expressions-regex/) for the first time that will be most relevant in the second module where we will be getting into shell scripting.  

For the first module, we will be using the following textbook:

[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) by Al Sweigart

Each week will have an assigned reading that is best completed prior to the class but can also be completed in a pinch after the lecture on the particular topic. Lectures are recorded but are not linked in the schedule and can be found via Panopto in Canvas. 

Outside of Homework 0 which has an accelerated timeline, assignments will generally follow a cadence where the assignment is assigned on Monday, can be submitted early (Friday) for a slight bit of extra credit, and has an official due date being on Monday.  Assignments are due at 10 PM generally unless specified otherwise with the five minute grace period as discussed in class.
