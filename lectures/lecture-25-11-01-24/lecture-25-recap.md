# Recap - Lecture 25 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we worked through the remaining examples on `sed` and presented `awk`.  We also dived in depth on the scripts that get invoked on a login, looking at the `/etc` directory and where various login scripts are located.

## Key Points

* Be able to reason through / examine the example scripts from `/etc/profile`
* What does `/etc` contain?
* What is an environmental variable and how do you change it for the result to persist after running the script?
* What is `sed`?
* What is `awk`?
* How do you typically use `sed` and `awk`? 

## Looking Ahead

Homework 6 currently looks at writing unit tests and then using a shell script to interpret the results. There is an example now added to the Homework 6 directory in the `examples` sub-directory. We will wrap up shell scripting this coming Monday and then transition into looking at system-based C content.  Remember, Exam 2 will only cover through the end of the shell script content.  

You are welcome to look ahead to Homework 7 where you will try to write a shell script that automatically unpacks and archive and examines it for various strings / content.
