# Recap - Lecture 9 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we covered the usage of groups and backreferencing with regular expressions.  We continued on with the Python requests package and then discussed / wrapped up JSONs, XML, and YAML.  We wrapped up the lecture discussing the map function with a small discussion of lambda.

Looking ahead, we will continue to build on discussions map, reduce, and filter, begin discussing list comprehensions, and dive into the nuance of generators and iterators and why they matter.  We will then be continuing next week looking at performance and parallelization as well as starting to prep for the upcoming first exam.
