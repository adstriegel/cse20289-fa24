# Recap - Lecture 33 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we focused on exploring the `const char *` construct from last lecture and then dived into how memory is arranged in processes covering the code, data, stack, and heap spaces.

## Key Points - C Programming

* What is a buffer overflow? How does it differ from a stack overflow?
* Why was the correct answer on the quiz 40 bytes for the sizeof instead of 33? What option could make it 33?
* Will -1 as an index for an array still compile?
* What is a union? struct? typdef?
* How does a struct differ from a union?
* How can you clearly state the size of the type of integer that you want (include file, specification)?


## Looking Ahead

Homework 9 is now assigned and will be due this coming Monday.  Remember, Friday's lecture will be a virtual lecture.
