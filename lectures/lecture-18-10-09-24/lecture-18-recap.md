## Looking Ahead

As mentioned in class, Homeworks 5 and 6 will be individual and from there onwards, homework will be group homework.  On Friday, we will cover some aspects of networking as related to Homework 5 (and networking generally).  From there we will start to dive deeper into the mechanics of shell scripting including variables and flow control as time allows.
