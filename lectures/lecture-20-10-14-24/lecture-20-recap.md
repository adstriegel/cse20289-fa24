# Recap - Lecture 20 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we got deep into looking at writing shell scripts with conditional functionality, specifically exploring how one defines variables, how one executes / capture the results of commands, how to do flow control (conditionals, loops), and how testing works with shell scripts.

## Key Points

* How do you set and access a variable?
* How do you have a variable impact the variables for the shell?
* How do you enable debugging in shell scripts?
* What is the purpose of the backtick (`\``)?  What is the $ and parentheses combination used for?
* What is command substitution? Given an example.
* How do conditionals work?
* How do loops work?
* Is there an equivalent of switch? What is it?
* What do the square brackets do?
* How do arguments work with shell scripts?

## Looking Ahead

In the next lecture, we will continue to look at various shell script examples and then work on writing code together in class.  We are particularly interested in how we can pipe input / output between scripts and how we can iterate over various results inside of our scripts.
