# Recap - Lecture 32 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we focused on exploring the `const char *` construct from last lecture and then dived into how memory is arranged in processes covering the code, data, stack, and heap spaces.

## Key Points - C Programming

* What is the difference between `const char *` and `char * const`? Why does it matter?
* What is a stack trace?
* What are the four memory segments for a running process and what is the purpose of each segment?
* How does the stack work?
* Where are global and static variables placed?
* How does the heap differ from the stack?
* How is the stack used to hold information when calling a function?
* What is a stack overflow?
* Why did the code example from lecture cause a bus error?
