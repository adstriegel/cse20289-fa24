# Recap - Lecture 10 - Topics Covered

In today's lecture, we largely moved on from regular expressions to focus on the usage of lambdas, reduce, and filter.  We also explored list comphrensions as well as introduced the concept of a generator and how the yield statement relates to a generator versus a function.
